# Pizza order system, flavour: Vue and Kotlin

Gonna make this a lasting tradition of mine. Everytime i really want to learn something new well, i'll try to make a pizza order system with it. 


Current technologies:

- Backend
  - Kotlin as the backend language
  - Gradle for building
  - Javalin for REST API
  - Firebase for database storing
  - Firebase authentication (NOT DONE)
  - Github Actions for CI
- Frontend (NOT STARTED)
  - Vue ?
